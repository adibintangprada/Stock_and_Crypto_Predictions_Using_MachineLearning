# Stock and Crypto Predictions Using Machine Learning
This is a model for predicting several stocks and cryptocurrency using machine learning

## Stocks and Cryptocurrency
The stocks and cryptocurrency provided for this model are (5 year from 2016-2019, 2021 Q1-Q2 used as predictions data) :
* BBCA
* BBRI
* TLKM
* BTC
* ETH
* USDT

## Dataset
You can acquire the dataset by downloading historical price from Yahoo Finance or use the yahoo historical python library.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in these models are Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor

## Further Improvements
The result in this models are far from prefect. So, i'm suggesting that if you want an improvements you should explore Deep Learning models like LSTM, RNN, or GRU and Time Series analysis
